# MARIOTT-DATA-BREACH


## Objective

To assess and prevent cybersecurity vulnerabilities by implementing robust security measures, focusing on preventing data exfiltration, strengthening encryption, improving network segmentation, and conducting regular security audits. The goal is to minimize risks and ensure compliance with security standards, as demonstrated by the Marriott International data breach case.

## Skills learned

Data Encryption: Understanding the importance of advanced encryption techniques to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

Intrusion Detection and Monitoring: Enhancing real-time monitoring systems to detect unauthorized lateral movement within networks and prevent long-term breaches.

Network Segmentation: Implementing strong network segmentation strategies to limit the ability of attackers to move freely across systems.

Vulnerability Management: Conducting regular vulnerability assessments and applying security patches promptly to close known weaknesses.

Incident Response and Compliance: Developing response plans for breaches, notifying affected parties, and understanding regulatory requirements, such as in the Marriott breach case involving a $124 million settlement and regulatory investigationsâ€‹.
